# Mapping_Earthquakes

Using Javascript, D3, Leaflet, and Mapbox, I helped create data visualization for a disaster reporting network. We created a map with interactive features on earthquake data around the world. 

## The map: 

We created a map with interactive options for users. The map can be viewed in different styles including satellite and night mode.  Users can also filter certain data from view including the ability to see tectonic plates, all earthquakes, and/ or major earthquakes exclusively. 

The map includes circle markers for each earthquake. The size and color of the circles are a reflection of their magnitude.

## The information: 

We used earthquake geoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website.
